# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

The solutions aren't pretty, but they did get me 50 stars *almost* within 25 days - day 20 was super hard and I had to revisit that one a couple of dats layer to pick up the second star.

Frankly I think C# isn't well geared toward these kinds of challenges and there's a lot of noisy syntax that makes things a but murky.
